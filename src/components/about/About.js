            I am a fourth year student at Northeastern University, currently applying for my third Co-op
          position. I have a combined major of Computer Science and Physics because I love to explore
          the interactions between technology and the universe.

          <p className={"about-discription " + this.state.width}>
            Thanks to Northeasternâ€™s Co-op program, I have gained valuable, real-life experience as both a
          laboratory technician at LiquiGlide and a software developer at Power Advocate. Having worked in
          each of my fields of study in the past, I hope to combine my passions for my next position from
          July to December 2018.

            When I am not working hard in classes or at work, I enjoy hiking and camping in my home state of
          New Hampshire and fawning over dogs.
